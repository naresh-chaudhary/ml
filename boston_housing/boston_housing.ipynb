In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- Graphs with `'max_depth = 6'` and `'max_depth = 10'` are not converging graphs.They represent high variance models. Hence they are moving towards overfitting. So `'max_depth'` must be less than 6.\n",
    "- Graph with `'max_depth = 1'` represent High bias model as neither of the training and testing scores are good enough.\n",
    "- Graph with `'max_depth = 3'` is just right as it has a decent score and the learning curves are converging as well.\n",
    "- So, we can conclude that `'max_depth =3'` is good for the model.\n",
    "- Adding more datapoints to the model decreases the training score and increases the testing score until they both converge to particular scores. In other words, adding more datapoints to the model increases the training error, and decreases the testing error until they converge to particular errors.\n",
    "- Adding more datapoints to the model having training and testing curves converging doesn't help much as the score will not improve until some modifications in the model itself are not made. Eg. In graph with `'max_depth = 1'` adding more training points  after 200 is of no help as the score will not improve now. So, model needs to be improved hence `'max_depth = 3'` gives better score.\n"

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- At `'max_depth = 1'`, model suffers from high bias as the model is neither good at training score nor at validation score.\n",
    "- From the graph we can infer that increasing the max_depth, increases the training score to 1, meaning  that  the model starts to memorize the training data but fails to predict the test data as the validation score is decresing. Hence the model fails to generalize well at `'max_depth = 10'` and we can say that the model is overfitted here.\n"

    "* Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? \n",
    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- For an optimal model it is necessary to have good training and validation scores. A model which produces low validation score and a high training score is overfitted and a model which produces low training and low testing score is underfitted. So we need to identify the `'max_depth'` at which the both scores are good and close to each other. \n",

To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
